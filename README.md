# Password-Generator




Ok! this one was a lot of work. I have a friend of mine who is a web developer help me trouble shoot this project, because I kept on making attempts at the javascript and I simply could not make it work. I learned a lot about funtions and object literals while coding this, along with gettting a good grasp on J Queries. My friend talked a lot about being able to analyze other websites using the Chrome inspect tool, so I used insepct to try and get my Password-Generator to look a lot like Reddit's colors and layout. I was sort of succesful, but I need to practice more with making my layouts look better. 

I had a really hard time getting my porject to load up on GitHub Pages. I did my best to figure that out and I think I have it resolved.
